# Overview

The game that I developed is a recreation of Pong from Atari. It is a simple game that has 2 paddles or bars on either side of the screen. Each one moves up and down,and tries to hit a ball, if it hit the ball bounces back toward the other player, if it passes the other player and goes off the screen, a point is earned and the ball resets. You move the paddles with the up and down arrow keys, and the "S" and "W" keys for the other player. 

**Purpose**  
My purpose for wiritng this software was to understand basics in game development and to practice python coding with arcade. I wanted to create the code to something I knew well and understood the rules of, so that I could focus more on controling the code for my desired output.
